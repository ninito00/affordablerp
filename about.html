            <h3>Tenant-Centered News and Housing Resources</h3>
            <h3>Mission Statement</h3>
            <p>RPAL envisions a Rogers Park where all people can afford to live and contribute to a neighborhood that belongs to them. We recognize that Rogers Park is not unique in its need for community defense of these rights. Here, as elsewhere, this begins with the fight against profit-driven development and displacement of tenants, and with building a network of informed tenants committed to community care and collective power.
